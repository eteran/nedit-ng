 *   -- Henry Spencer
 * (Yes, it did!) -- Christopher Conrad, Dec. 1999
 *
 * January, 1994, Mark Edel
 *    Consolidated files, changed names of external functions to avoid
 *    potential conflicts with native regcomp and regexec functions, changed
 *    error reporting to NEdit form, added multi-line and reverse searching,
 *    and added \n \t \u \U \l \L.
 *
 * June, 1996, Mark Edel
 *    Bug in NEXT macro, didn't work for expressions which compiled to over
 *    256 bytes.
 *
 * December, 1999, Christopher Conrad
 *    Reformatted code for readability, improved error output, added octal and
 *    hexadecimal escapes, added back-references (\1-\9), added positive look
 *    ahead: (?=...), added negative lookahead: (?!...),  added non-capturing
 *    parentheses: (?:...), added case insensitive constructs (?i...) and
 *    (?I...), added newline matching constructs (?n...) and (?N...), added
 *    regex comments: (?#...), added shortcut escapes: \d\D\l\L\s\S\w\W\y\Y.
 *    Added "not a word boundary" anchor \B.
 *
 * July, 2002, Eddy De Greef
 *    Added look behind, both positive (?<=...) and negative (?<!...) for
 *    bounded-length patterns.
 *
 * November, 2004, Eddy De Greef
 *    Added constrained matching (allowing specification of the logical end
 *    of the string iso. matching till \0), and fixed several (probably
 *    very old) string overrun errors that could easily result in crashes,
 *    especially in client code.
