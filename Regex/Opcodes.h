/* STRUCTURE FOR A REGULAR EXPRESSION (regex) gPROGRAM'.
 *
 * This is essentially a linear encoding of a nondeterministic finite-state
 * machine or NFA (aka syntax charts or 'railroad normal form' in parsing
 * technology).  Each node is an opcode plus a NEXT pointer, possibly
 * followed by operands.  NEXT pointers of all nodes except BRANCH implement
 * concatenation; a NEXT pointer with a BRANCH on both ends of it is
 * connecting two alternatives.  (Here we have one of the subtle syntax
 * dependencies:  an individual BRANCH (as opposed to a collection of them) is
 * never concatenated with anything because of operator precedence.)  The
 * operand of some types of nodes is a literal string; for others, it is a node
 * leading into a sub-FSM.  In particular, the operand of a BRANCH node is the
 * first node of the branch. (NB this is _NOT_ a tree structure:  the tail of
 * the branch connects to the thing following the set of BRANCHes.)
 *
 * The opcodes are: */

/* OPCODE NOTES:
   ------------

   All nodes consist of an 8 bit op code followed by 2 bytes that make up a 16
   bit NEXT pointer.  Some nodes have a null terminated character string operand
   following the NEXT pointer.  Other nodes may have an 8 bit index operand.
   The TEST_COUNT node has an index operand followed by a 16 bit test value.
   The BRACE and LAZY_BRACE nodes have two 16 bit values for min and max but no
   index value.

   SIMILAR
	  Operand(s): null terminated string

	  Implements a case insensitive match of a string.  Mostly intended for use
	  in syntax highlighting patterns for keywords of languages like FORTRAN
	  and Ada that are case insensitive.  The regex text in this node is
	  converted to lower case during regex compile.

   DIGIT, NOT_DIGIT, LETTER, NOT_LETTER, SPACE, NOT_SPACE, WORD_CHAR,
   NOT_WORD_CHAR
	  Operand(s): None

	  Implements shortcut escapes \d, \D, \l, \L, \s, \S, \w, \W.  The locale
	  aware ANSI functions isdigit(), isalpha(), isalnum(), and isspace() are
	  used to implement these in the hopes of increasing portability.

   NOT_BOUNDARY
	  Operand(s): None

	  Implements \B as a zero width assertion that the current character is
	  NOT on a word boundary.  Word boundaries are defined to be the position
	  between two characters where one of those characters is one of the
	  dynamically defined word delimiters, and the other character is not.

   IS_DELIM
	  Operand(s): None

	  Implements \y as any character that is one of the dynamically
	  specified word delimiters.

   NOT_DELIM
	  Operand(s): None

	  Implements \Y as any character that is NOT one of the dynamically
	  specified word delimiters.

   STAR, PLUS, QUESTION, and complex '*', '+', and '?'
	  Operand(s): None (Note: NEXT pointer is usually zero.  The code that
						processes this node skips over it.)

	  Complex (parenthesized) versions implemented as circular BRANCH
	  structures using BACK.  SIMPLE versions (one character per match) are
	  implemented separately for speed and to minimize recursion.

   BRACE, LAZY_BRACE
	  Operand(s): minimum value (2 bytes), maximum value (2 bytes)

	  Implements the {m,n} construct for atoms that are SIMPLE.

   BRANCH
	  Operand(s): None

	  The set of branches constituting a single choice are hooked together
	  with their NEXT pointers, since precedence prevents anything being
	  concatenated to any individual branch.  The NEXT pointer of the last
	  BRANCH in a choice points to the thing following the whole choice.  This
	  is also where the final NEXT pointer of each individual branch points;
	  each branch starts with the operand node of a BRANCH node.

   BACK
	  Operand(s): None

	  Normal NEXT pointers all implicitly point forward.  Back implicitly
	  points backward.  BACK exists to make loop structures possible.

   INIT_COUNT
	  Operand(s): index (1 byte)

	  Initializes the count array element referenced by the index operand.
	  This node is used to build general (i.e. parenthesized) {m,n} constructs.

   INC_COUNT
	  Operand(s): index (1 byte)

	  Increments the count array element referenced by the index operand.
	  This node is used to build general (i.e. parenthesized) {m,n} constructs.

   TEST_COUNT
	  Operand(s): index (1 byte), test value (2 bytes)

	  Tests the current value of the count array element specified by the
	  index operand against the test value.  If the current value is less than
	  the test value, control passes to the node after that TEST_COUNT node.
	  Otherwise control passes to the node referenced by the NEXT pointer for
	  the TEST_COUNT node.  This node is used to build general (i.e.
	  parenthesized) {m,n} constructs.

   BACK_REF, BACK_REF_CI
	  Operand(s): index (1 byte, value 1-9)

	  Implements back references.  This node will attempt to match whatever text
	  was most recently captured by the index'th set of parentheses.
	  BACK_REF_CI is case insensitive version.

   X_REGEX_BR, X_REGEX_BR_CI
	  (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

	  Operand(s): index (1 byte, value 1-9)

	  Implements back references into a previously matched but separate regular
	  expression.  This is used by syntax highlighting patterns. This node will
	  attempt to match whatever text was most captured by the index'th set of
	  parentheses of the separate regex passed to ExecRE. X_REGEX_BR_CI is case
	  insensitive version.

   POS_AHEAD_OPEN, NEG_AHEAD_OPEN, LOOK_AHEAD_CLOSE

	  Operand(s): None

	  Implements positive and negative look ahead.  Look ahead is an assertion
	  that something is either there or not there.   Once this is determined the
	  regex engine backtracks to where it was just before the look ahead was
	  encountered, i.e. look ahead is a zero width assertion.

   POS_BEHIND_OPEN, NEG_BEHIND_OPEN, LOOK_BEHIND_CLOSE

	  Operand(s): 2x2 bytes for OPEN (match boundaries), None for CLOSE

	  Implements positive and negative look behind.  Look behind is an assertion
	  that something is either there or not there in front of the current
	  position.  Look behind is a zero width assertion, with the additional
	  constraint that it must have a bounded length (for complexity and
	  efficiency reasons; note that most other implementation even impose
	  fixed length).

   OPEN, CLOSE

	  Operand(s): None

	  OPEN  + n = Start of parenthesis 'n', CLOSE + n = Close of parenthesis
	  'n', and are numbered at compile time.
