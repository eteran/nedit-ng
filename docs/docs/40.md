## Solutions to Common Problems

For a much more comprehensive list of common problems and solutions, see

**Find Again and Replace Again don't continue in the same direction as the original Find or Replace.**  

Find Again and Replace Again don't use the direction of the original search. <kbd>Shift</kbd> controls the direction: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> means forward, <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> means backward.


**Preferences specified in the Preferences menu don't seem to get saved when I select Preferences &rarr; Save Defaults.**  

NEdit has two kinds of preferences:  

1. per-window preferences, in the **Preferences** menu. 
2. default settings for preferences in newly created windows, in **Preferences &rarr; Default Settings**. Per-window preferences are not saved by **Save Defaults**, only **Default Settings**.

**NEdit performs poorly on very large files.**  

Turn off **Incremental Backup**. With **Incremental Backup** on, NEdit periodically writes a full copy of the file to disk.

**Commands added to the Shell Commands menu (Unix only) don't output anything until they are finished executing.**  

If the command output is directed to a dialog, or the input is from a selection, 
output is collected together and held until the command completes. De-select 
both of the options and the output will be shown incrementally as the 
command executes.

## Known Defects

Below is the list of known defects which affect NEdit-ng.

### All Versions

**DEFECT**

Operations between rectangular selections on overlapping lines do
nothing.

***Work Around***

None. These operations are very complicated and rarely used.

**DEFECT**

Cut and Paste menu items fail, or possibly crash, for very large
(multi-megabyte) selections.

***Work Around***

Use selection copy (middle mouse button click) for transferring larger
quantities of data. Cut and Paste save the copied text in server memory,
which is usually limited.
