# Crash Recovery(36)

If a system crash, network failure, X server crash, or program error
should happen while you are editing a file, you can still recover most
of your work. NEdit-ng maintains a backup file which it updates
periodically (every 8 editing operations or 80 characters typed). This
file has the same name as the file that you are editing, but with the
character `~` (tilde) prefixed to the name. To recover a file after a
crash, simply rename the file to remove the tilde character, replacing
the older version of the file. (Because several of the Unix shells
consider the tilde to be a special character, you may have to prefix the
character with a `\` (backslash) when you move or delete an NEdit-ng
backup file.)

Example, to recover the file called "help.c" on Unix type the command:

    mv ~help.c help.c

A minor caveat, is that if the file you were editing was in MS DOS
format, the backup file will be in Unix format, and you will need to
open the backup file in NEdit-ng and change the file format back to MS
DOS via the Save As... dialog (or use the Unix `unix2dos` command
outside of NEdit-ng).
