"clicking and dragging. Quadruple clicking selects the whole file. After ",
"releasing the mouse button, you can still adjust a selection by holding down ",
"the shift key and dragging on either end of the selection. To delete the ",
"selected text, press delete or backspace. To replace it, begin typing. ",
"\n\n",
"To select a rectangle or column of text, hold the Ctrl key while dragging the ",
"mouse. Rectangular selections can be used in any context that normal ",
"selections can be used, including cutting and pasting, filling, shifting, ",
"dragging, and searching. Operations on rectangular selections automatically ",
"fill in tabs and spaces to maintain alignment of text within and to the right ",
"of the selection. Note that the interpretation of rectangular selections by ",
"Fill Paragraph is slightly different from that of other commands, the section ",
"titled \"\01QShifting and Filling\01I\" has details. ",

"this selection will be copied to the insert position of the window where the ",
"mouse was last clicked (the destination window). This position is marked by a ",
"caret shaped cursor when the mouse is outside of the destination window.  If ",
"there is a (primary) selection, adjacent to the cursor in the window, the new ",

"rectangular form, allowing it to be dragged outside of the bounds of the ",
"existing text. ",

"on searching, where every character typed triggers a new search.  After you've ",

"Text filling using the Fill Paragraph command in the Edit menu is one of the ",
"most important concepts in NEdit.  And it will be well worth your while to ",
"understand how to use it properly. ",
"\n\n",
"In plain text files, unlike word-processor files, there is no way to tell ",
"which lines are continuations of other lines, and which lines are meant to be ",
"separate, because there is no distinction in meaning between newline ",
"characters which separate lines in a paragraph, and ones which separate ",
"paragraphs from other text.  This makes it impossible for a text editor like ",
"NEdit to tell parts of the text which belong together as a paragraph from ",
"carefully arranged individual lines. ",
"\n\n",
"In continuous wrap mode (Preferences -> Wrap -> Continuous), lines ",
"automatically wrap and unwrap themselves to line up properly at the right ",
"margin.  In this mode, you simply omit the newlines within paragraphs and let ",
"NEdit make the line breaks as needed.  Unfortunately, continuous wrap mode is ",
"not appropriate in the majority of situations, because files with extremely ",
"long lines are not common under Unix and may not be compatible with all ",
"tools, and because you can't achieve effects like indented sections, columns, ",
"or program comments, and still take advantage of the automatic wrapping. ",
"\n\n",
"Without continuous wrapping, paragraph filling is not entirely automatic. ",
"Auto-Newline wrapping keeps paragraphs lined up as you type, but once ",
"entered, NEdit can no longer distinguish newlines which join wrapped text, ",
"and newlines which must be preserved.  Therefore, editing in the middle of a ",
"paragraph will often leave the right margin messy and uneven. ",
"\n\n",
"Since NEdit can't act automatically to keep your text lined up, you need to ",
"tell it explicitly where to operate, and that is what Fill Paragraph is for. ",
"It arranges lines to fill the space between two margins, wrapping the lines ",
"neatly at word boundaries.  Normally, the left margin for filling is inferred ",
"from the text being filled.  The first line of each paragraph is considered ",
"special, and its left indentation is maintained separately from the remaining ",
"lines (for leading indents, bullet points, numbered paragraphs, etc.). ",
"Otherwise, the left margin is determined by the furthest left non-whitespace ",
"character.  The right margin is either the Wrap Margin, set in the ",
"preferences menu (by default, the right edge of the window), or can also be ",
"chosen on the fly by using a rectangular selection (see below). ",
"\n\n",
"There are three ways to use Fill Paragraph.  The simplest is, while you are ",
"typing text, and there is no selection, simply select Fill Paragraph (or type ",
"Ctrl+J), and NEdit will arrange the text in the paragraph adjacent to the ",
"cursor.  A paragraph, in this case, means an area of text delimited by blank ",
"lines. ",
"\n\n",
"The second way to use Fill Paragraph is with a selection.  If you select a ",
"range of text and then chose Fill Paragraph, all of the text in the selection ",
"will be filled.  Again, continuous text between blank lines is interpreted as ",
"paragraphs and filled individually, respecting leading indents and blank ",
"lines. ",
"\n\n",
"The third, and most versatile, way to use Fill Paragraph is with a ",
"rectangular selection.  Fill Paragraph treats rectangular selections ",
"differently from other commands.  Instead of simply filling the text inside ",
"the rectangular selection, NEdit interprets the right edge of the selection ",
"as the requested wrap margin.  Text to the left of the selection is not ",
"disturbed (the usual interpretation of a rectangular selection), but text to ",
"the right of the selection is included in the operation and is pulled in to ",
"the selected region.  This method enables you to fill text to an arbitrary ",
"right margin, without going back and forth to the wrap-margin dialog, as well ",
"as to exclude text to the left of the selection such as comment bars or other ",
"text columns. ",

"line termination, and wrapping. ",
"\n\n",
"While character set differences are the most obvious and pose the most ",
"challenge to portability, they affect NEdit only indirectly via the same font ",
"and localization mechanisms common to all X applications.  If your system is ",
"set up properly, you will probably never see character-set related problems ",
"in NEdit.  NEdit cannot display Unicode text files, nor any multi-byte ",
"character set. ",
"\n\n",
"The primary difference between an MS DOS format file and a Unix format file, ",
"is how the lines are terminated.  Unix uses a single newline character.  MS ",
"DOS uses a carriage-return and a newline.  NEdit can read and write both file ",
"formats, but internally, it uses the single character Unix standard.  NEdit ",
"auto-detects MS DOS format files based on the line termination at the start ",
"of the file.  Files are judged to be DOS format if all of the first five line ",
"terminators, within a maximum range, are DOS-style.  To change the format in ",
"which NEdit writes a file from DOS to Unix or visa versa, use the Save As... ",
"command and check or un-check the MS DOS Format button. ",
"\n\n",
"Wrapping within text files can vary among individual users, as well as from ",
"system to system.  Both Windows and MacOS make frequent use of plain text ",
"files with no implicit right margin.  In these files, wrapping is determined ",
"by the tool which displays them.  Files of this style also exist on Unix ",
"systems, despite the fact that they are not supported by all Unix utilities. ",
"To display this kind of file properly in NEdit, you have to select the wrap ",
"style called Continuous.  Wrapping modes are discussed in the sections: ",
"Customizing -> Preferences, and Basic Operation -> Shifting and Filling. ",
"\n\n",
"The last and most minute of format differences is the terminating newline. ",
"Some Unix compilers and utilities require a final terminating newline on all ",
"files they read and fail in various ways on files which do not have it.  Vi ",
"and approximately half of Unix editors enforce the terminating newline on all ",

"that `{,}' and `{}' are both valid brace constructs.  A single number ",

"digit from 1 to 9 (example: \\3).  Backreferences have similar syntax to ",
"substitutions (see below), but are different from substitutions in that they ",
"appear within the regular expression, not the substitution string. The number ",
"specified with a backreference identifies which set of text capturing ",
"parentheses the backreference is associated with. The text that was most ",
"recently captured by these parentheses is used by the backreference to ",
"attempt a match.  As with substitutions, open parentheses are counted from ",
"left to right beginning with 1.  So the backreference `\\3' will try to match ",
"another occurrence of the text most recently matched by the third set of ",
"capturing parentheses.  As an example, the regular expression `(\\d)\\1' could ",
"match `22', `33', or `00', but wouldn't match `19' or `01'. ",
"\n\n",
"A backreference must be associated with a parenthetical expression that is ",
"complete.  The expression `(\\w(\\1))' contains an invalid backreference since ",
"the first set of parentheses are not complete at the point where the ",
"backreference appears. ",
"\n\n",
"\01RSubstitution\01I",

"Substitution strings are used to replace text matched by a set of capturing ",
"parentheses.  The substitution string is mostly interpreted as ordinary text ",
"except as follows. ",
"\n\n",
"The escape sequences described above for special characters, and octal and ",
"hexadecimal escapes are treated the same way by a substitution string. When ",
"the substitution string contains the `&' character, NEdit will substitute the ",

"1 to 9 that represents the string matched by a parenthesized expression ",
"within the regular expression.  These expressions are numbered left-to-right ",
"in order of their opening parentheses. ",

"has to be made.  If there is more than one choice, the next will be made in ",
"the same manner (earliest possibility) subject to the decision on the first ",
"choice.  And so forth. ",
"\n\n",
"For example, `(ab|a)b*c' could match `abc' in one of two ways.  The first ",

static char * htxt_rangeset [] = {
"\01IRangesets are a tool of the macro language to tag parts, or ranges, of the ",
"text, which shall be viewed as a group. A range is merely a contiguous range ",
"of characters between a start and an end position in the document, and a set ",
"of ranges belonging together is called a rangeset. So, a rangeset is nothing ",
"but an in general non-contiguous part of the text. ",
"\n\n",
"Rangesets can be assigned a background color to make them visible: characters ",
"within all ranges of a rangeset will have the background color of the ",
"rangeset. (If more than one rangeset includes a given character, its ",
"background color will be that of the most recently created rangeset which has ",
"a color defined.) ",
"\n\n",
"Applications of rangesets are for example: ",
"\n\n",
"    * Showing differences between two versions of a file. Then, one rangeset would be those parts of the current file that are not in the prior version.\n",
"    * Highlighting all occurrences of a particular pattern, e.g. showing all the strings 'foobar' in the file.\n",
"    * Highlighting spelling mistakes found by a spell-checker.\n",
"\n",
"Rangesets are manipulated only through macro routines. Rangesets must be ",
"created first using the rangeset_create() function, which will return an ",
"identifier for the newly-created (empty) rangeset. This identifier is then ",
"passed to the other rangeset functions to manipulate the rangeset. For ",
"example, ranges are added to a rangeset with the rangeset_add() function. ",
"\n\n",
"Notice that the ranges inside a rangeset do not have a particular identity. ",
"Only, they are given a (dynamically changing) numeric index, counting from 1, ",
"in the order of appearance in the text buffer. The ranges are adjusted when ",
"modifications are made to the text buffer: they shift around when characters ",
"are added or deleted staying with the original strings of characters. ",
"However, ranges within a set will coalesce if the characters between them are ",
"removed, or a new range is added to  the set which bridges or overlaps ",
"others. For more on this, see \"How rangesets change with modifications\". ",
"\n\n",
"There is a limit to the number of rangesets which can exist at any time - ",
"currently up to 63 in each document. Care should be taken to destroy any ",
"rangesets which are no longer needed, by using the rangeset_destroy() ",
"function, if this limit is attained. ",
"\n\n",
"Rangesets can be named: this is useful for macros which need a fixed ",
"identification for rangesets which are used for the same purpose in different ",
"documents. Although a new rangeset's number is arbitrary, its name can be ",
"fixed.  This is done using the rangeset_set_name() function. Note that ",
"rangeset names within a particular document may not be unique. For this ",
"reason, the rangeset_get_by_name() function returns an array of identifiers, ",
"which will be empty if the name has not been associated with a rangeset. ",
"\n\n",
"\01SHow rangesets change with modifications\01I",
"\n\n",
"When changes are made to the document text, ranges within each set are altered ",
"with it, according to their behavioral mode.  If changes are made outside of ",
"the ranges in a rangeset, each range simply maintains its size and adjusts its ",
"position to match the changes.  When text within a range is deleted, the ",
"range's length is reduced by the same amount. When changes involving new text ",
"are made within a range of the set, or to one of the extremities of a range, ",
"different behaviours may be desirable. The rangeset_set_mode() function allows ",
"these modes to be chosen. ",
"\n\n",
"Note that the precise behaviour of these modes may change in future versions ",
"of NEdit. ",
"\n\n",
"The available modes are: ",
"\n\n",
"\01Jmaintain\01I or \01Jins_del\01I - ",
"Both these modes have the same behaviour.  New text added at the front of a ",
"range in a set is not added to the range; new text added within the range or ",
"at the end extends the range.  Replacement overlapping an extremity of the ",
"set acts as if the new text were added first, then the old text deleted. ",
"This causes curtailment at the front of the range, extension at the end. ",
"Replacement of the full text of the range removes the range from the set. ",
"The default behaviour for a newly created rangeset is \01Jmaintain\01I. ",
"\n\n",
"\01Jdel_ins\01I - ",
"New text added at the front or end of a range in a set is not added to the ",
"range; new text added within the range extends the range.  Replacement ",
"overlapping an extremity of the set acts as if the old text were deleted ",
"first, then the new text added. This causes curtailment at either end. ",
"Replacement of the full text of the range removes the range from the set. ",
"\n\n",
"\01Jinclude\01I - ",
"New text added at the front or end of a range in a set extends the range, as ",
"does new text added within the range.  Replacement overlapping an extremity ",
"of the set acts as if the new text were added first, then the old text ",
"deleted.  This causes curtailment at the front of the range, extension at ",
"the end.  Replacement of the full text of the range adds the new text to the ",
"range if the start position of the replacement is at the range's start ",
"point. ",
"\n\n",
"\01Jexclude\01I - ",
"New text added at the front or end of a range in a set does not extend the ",
"range; new text added within the range extends the range.  Replacement ",
"overlapping an extremity causes curtailment of the range.  Replacement of ",
"the full text of the range removes the range from the set. ",

"\01Jbreak\01I - ",

"highlighting.  If you don't intend to use syntax highlighting, you can ignore ",
"most of the dialog, and just set the field labeled Primary Font. ",
"\n\n",
"Unless you are absolutely certain about the types of files that you will be ",
"editing with NEdit, you should choose a fixed-spacing font.  Many, if not ",
"most, plain-text files are written expecting to be viewed with fixed ",
"character spacing, and will look wrong with proportional spacing.  NEdit's ",
"filling, wrapping, and rectangular operations will also work strangely if you ",
"choose a proportional font. ",
"\n\n",
"Note that in the font browser (the dialog brought up by the Browse... ",
"button), the subset of fonts which are shown is narrowed depending on the ",
"characteristics already selected.  It is therefore important to know that you ",
"can unselect characteristics from the lists by clicking on the selected items ",
"a second time. ",
"\n\n",
"Fonts for syntax highlighting should ideally match the primary font in both ",
"height and spacing.  A mismatch in spacing will result in similar distortions ",
"as choosing a proportional font: column alignment will sometimes look wrong, ",
"and rectangular operations, wrapping, and filling will behave strangely.  A ",
"mismatch in height will cause windows to re-size themselves slightly when ",
"syntax highlighting is turned on or off, and increase the inter-line spacing ",
"of the text.  Unfortunately, on some systems it is hard to find sets of fonts ",
"which match exactly in height. ",
"\n\n",
"\01RCustomizing Menus\01I",
"\n\n",
"You can add or change items in the Shell, Macro, and window background menus ",
"under Preferences -> Default Settings -> Customize Menus.  When you choose ",
"one of these, you will see a dialog with a list of the current ",
"user-configurable items from the menu on the left.  To change an existing ",
"item, select it from the list, and its properties will appear in the ",
"remaining fields of the dialog, where you may change them.  Selecting the ",
"item \"New\" from the list allows you to enter new items in the menu. ",
"\n\n",
"Hopefully most of the characteristics are self explanatory, but here are a ",
"few things to note: ",
"\n\n",
"Accelerator keys are keyboard shortcuts which appear on the right hand side ",
"of the menus, and allow you avoid pulling down the menu and activate the ",
"command with a single keystroke.  Enter accelerators by typing the keys ",
"exactly as you would to activate the command. ",
"\n\n",
"Mnemonics are a single letter which should be part of the menu item name, ",
"which allow users to traverse and activate menu items by typing keys when the ",
"menu is pulled down. ",
"\n\n",
"In the Shell Command field of the Shell Commands dialog, the % character ",
"expands to the name (including directory path) of the file in the window.  To ",
"include a % character in the command, use %%. ",
"\n\n",
"The Menu Entry field can contain special characters for constructing ",
"hierarchical sub-menus, and for making items which appear only in certain ",
"language modes.  The right angle bracket character \">\" creates a sub-menu. ",
"The name of the item itself should be the last element of the path formed ",
"from successive sub-menu names joined with \">\".  Menu panes are called in to ",
"existence simply by naming them as part of a Menu Entry name.  To put several ",
"items in the same sub-menu, repeat the same hierarchical sequence for each. ",
"For example, in the Macro Commands dialog, two items with menu entries: a>b>c ",
"and a>b>d would create a single sub menu under the macro menu called \"a\", ",
"which would contain a single sub-menu, b, holding the actual items, c and d: ",
"\n\n",
"\01A      +---++---++---+\n",
"      |a >||b >||c  |\n",
"      +---++---+|d  |\n",
"                +---+\n",
"\01I\n",
"To qualify a menu entry with a language mode, simply add an at-sign \"@\" at ",
"the end of the menu command, followed (no space) by a language mode name.  To ",
"make a menu item which appears in several language modes, append additional ",
"@s and language mode names.  For example, an item with the menu entry: ",
"\n\n",
"\01A    Make C Prototypes@C@C++\n",
"\01I\n",
"would appear only in C and C++ language modes, and: ",
"\n\n",
"\01A    Make Class Template@C++\n",
"\01I\n",
"would appear only in C++ mode. ",
"\n\n",
"Menu items with no qualification appear in all language modes. ",
"\n\n",
"If a menu item is followed by the single language qualification \"@*\", that ",
"item will appear only if there are no applicable language-specific items of ",
"the same name in the same submenu.  For example, if you have the following ",
"three entries in the same menu: ",
"\n\n",
"\01A    Make Prototypes@C@C++\n",
"    Make Prototypes@Java\n",
"    Make Prototypes@*\n",
"\01I\n",
"The first will be available when the language mode is C or C++, the second ",
"when the language mode is Java, and for all other language modes (including ",
"the \"Plain\" non-language mode).  If the entry: ",
"\n\n",
"\01A    Make Prototypes\n",
"\01I\n",
"also exists, this will always appear, meaning that the menu will always have ",
"two \"Make Prototypes\" entries, whatever the language mode. ",
"\n\n",
"\01RThe NEdit Autoload Files\01I",
"\n\n",
"At startup time, NEdit automatically reads the preferences file ",

"\01RWriting Syntax Highlighting Patterns\01I",
"\n\n",
"Patterns are the mechanism by which language syntax highlighting is ",
"implemented in NEdit (see \01QSyntax Highlighting\01I under the heading of Features ",
"for Programming). To create syntax highlighting patterns for a new ",
"language, or to modify existing patterns, select \"Recognition Patterns\" from ",
"\"Syntax Highlighting\" sub-section of the \"Default Settings\" sub-menu of the ",
"\"Preferences\" menu. ",
"\n\n",
"First, a word of caution.  As with regular expression matching in general, it ",
"is quite possible to write patterns which are so inefficient that they ",
"essentially lock up the editor as they recursively re-examine the entire ",
"contents of the file thousands of times.  With the multiplicity of patterns, ",
"the possibility of a lock-up is significantly increased in syntax ",
"highlighting.  When working on highlighting patterns, be sure to save your ",
"work frequently. ",
"\n\n",
"NEdit's syntax highlighting is unusual in that it works in real-time (as you ",
"type), and yet is completely programmable using standard regular expression ",
"notation.  Other syntax highlighting editors usually fall either into the ",
"category of fully programmable but unable to keep up in real-time, or ",
"real-time but limited programmability.  The additional burden that NEdit ",
"places on pattern writers in order to achieve this speed/flexibility mix, is ",
"to force them to state self-imposed limitations on the amount of context that ",
"patterns may examine when re-parsing after a change.  While the \"Pattern ",
"Context Requirements\" heading is near the end of this section, it is not ",
"optional, and must be understood before making any serious effort at ",
"pattern writing. ",
"\n\n",
"In its simplest form, a highlight pattern consists of a regular expression to ",
"match, along with a style representing the font an color for displaying any ",
"text which matches that expression.  To bold the word, \"highlight\", wherever ",
"it appears the text, the regular expression simply would be the word ",
"\"highlight\".  The style (selected from the menu under the heading of ",
"\"Highlight Style\") determines how the text will be drawn.  To bold the text, ",
"either select an existing style, such as \"Keyword\", which bolds text, or ",
"create a new style and select it under Highlight Style. ",
"\n\n",
"The full range of regular expression capabilities can be applied in such a ",
"pattern, with the single caveat that the expression must conclusively match ",
"or not match, within the pre-defined context distance (as discussed below ",
"under Pattern Context Requirements). ",
"\n\n",
"To match longer ranges of text, particularly any constructs which exceed the ",
"requested context, you must use a pattern which highlights text between a ",
"starting and ending regular expression match.  To do so, select \"Highlight ",
"text between starting and ending REs\" under \"Matching\", and enter both a ",
"starting and ending regular expression.  For example, to highlight everything ",
"between double quotes, you would enter a double quote character in both the ",
"starting and ending regular expression fields.  Patterns with both a ",
"beginning and ending expression span all characters between the two ",
"expressions, including newlines. ",
"\n\n",
"Again, the limitation for automatic parsing to operate properly is that both ",
"expressions must match within the context distance stated for the pattern ",
"set. ",
"\n\n",
"With the ability to span large distances, comes the responsibility to recover ",
"when things go wrong.  Remember that syntax highlighting is called upon to ",
"parse incorrect or incomplete syntax as often as correct syntax.  To stop a ",
"pattern short of matching its end expression, you can specify an error ",
"expression, which stops the pattern from gobbling up more than it should. ",
"For example, if the text between double quotes shouldn't contain newlines, ",
"the error expression might be \"$\".  As with both starting and ending ",
"expressions, error expressions must also match within the requested context ",
"distance. ",
"\n\n",
"\01SColoring Sub-Expressions\01I",
"\n\n",
"It is also possible to color areas of text within a regular expression ",
"match.  A pattern of this type associates a style with sub-expressions ",
"references of the parent pattern (as used in regular expression substitution ",
"patterns, see the NEdit Help menu item on Regular Expressions). ",
"Sub-expressions of both the starting and ending patterns may be colored.  For ",
"example, if the parent pattern has a starting expression \"\\<\", and end ",
"expression \"\\>\", (for highlighting all of the text contained within angle ",
"brackets), a sub-pattern using \"&\" in both the starting and ending expression ",
"fields could color the brackets differently from the intervening text.  A ",
"quick shortcut to typing in pattern names in the Parent Pattern field is to ",
"use the middle mouse button to drag them from the Patterns list. ",
"\n\n",
"In some cases, there can be interference between coloring sub-patterns and ",
"hierarchical sub-patterns (discussed next). How this is resolved, is ",
"explained below. ",
"\n\n",
"\01SHierarchical Patterns\01I",
"\n\n",
"A hierarchical sub-pattern, is identical to a top level pattern, but is ",
"invoked only between the starting and ending expression matches of its ",
"parent pattern or, in case the parent pattern consists of a single ",
"expression, inside the text area matching that expression.  Like the ",
"sub-expression coloring patterns discussed above, it is associated with a ",
"parent pattern using the Parent Pattern field in the pattern specification. ",
"Pattern names can be dragged from the pattern list with the middle mouse ",
"button to the Parent Pattern field. ",
"\n\n",
"The matching behaviour for sub-patterns is slightly different, depending on ",
"whether the parent pattern consists of a single expression or has both a ",
"starting and an ending expression. ",
"\n\n",
"In case the parent pattern consists of a single expression, and the syntax ",
"highlighting parser finds a match for that expression, sub-patterns are ",
"matched between the start and the end of the parent match.  Sub-patterns ",
"cannot extend beyond the boundaries of the parent's match nor can they ",
"affect those boundaries (the latter can happen for starting/ending parent ",
"patterns, see below). Note that sub-patterns can \01Kpeek\01I beyond the ",
"parent's matching boundaries by means of look-ahead or look-behind ",
"expressions. ",
"\n\n",
"In case the parent pattern is a starting/ending style pattern, after the ",
"start expression of the parent pattern matches, the syntax highlighting ",
"parser searches for either the parent's end pattern or a matching ",
"sub-pattern.  When a sub-pattern matches, control is not returned to the ",
"parent pattern until the entire sub-pattern has been parsed, regardless of ",
"whether the parent's end pattern appears in the text matched by the ",
"sub-pattern.  In this way, matching of the parent's ending pattern can be ",
"postponed, in contrast to the case where the parent pattern consists of a ",
"single expression. Note that, in this case, parsing of sub-patterns starts ",
"\01Jafter\01I the match of the parent pattern's starting expression, also in ",
"contrast to the single-expression case. ",
"\n\n",
"The most common use for this capability is for coloring sub-structure of ",
"language constructs (smaller patterns embedded in larger patterns). ",
"Hierarchical patterns can also simplify parsing by having sub-patterns \"hide\" ",
"special syntax from parent patterns, such as special escape sequences or ",
"internal comments. ",
"\n\n",
"There is no depth limit in nesting hierarchical sub-patterns, but beyond the ",
"third level of nesting, automatic re-parsing will sometimes have to re-parse ",
"more than the requested context distance to guarantee a correct parse (which ",
"can slow down the maximum rate at which the user can type if large sections ",
"of text are matched only by deeply nested patterns). ",
"\n\n",
"While this is obviously not a complete hierarchical language parser it is ",
"still useful in many text coloring situations.  As a pattern writer, your ",
"goal is not to completely cover the language syntax, but to generate ",
"colorings that are useful to the programmer.  Simpler patterns are usually ",
"more efficient and also more robust when applied to incorrect code. ",
"\n\n",
"Note that in case of a single-expression parent pattern, there is a ",
"potential for conflicts between coloring-only sub-patterns and hierarchical ",
"sub-patterns (which cannot happen for starting/ending type of patterns, ",
"because sub-patterns are matched \01Jbetween\01I the starting and ending pattern ",
"(not included)).  Due to the different nature of these two kinds of ",
"sub-patterns, it is technically infeasible to follow the standard matching ",
"precedence rules, where a sub-pattern has precedence over the sub-patterns ",
"following it.  Instead, coloring-only sub-patterns are always colored last, ",
"ie., they may override the coloring for overlapping sibling sub-patterns in ",
"the overlapping parts of the matches. ",
"\n\n",
"\01SDeferred (Pass-2) Parsing\01I",
"\n\n",
"NEdit does pattern matching for syntax highlighting in two passes.  The first ",
"pass is applied to the entire file when syntax highlighting is first turned ",
"on, and to new ranges of text when they are initially read or pasted in.  The ",
"second pass is applied only as needed when text is exposed (scrolled in to ",
"view). ",
"\n\n",
"If you have a particularly complex set of patterns, and parsing is beginning ",
"to add a noticeable delay to opening files or operations which change large ",
"regions of text, you can defer some of that parsing from startup time, to ",
"when it is actually needed for viewing the text.  Deferred parsing can only ",
"be used with single expression patterns, or begin/end patterns which match ",
"entirely within the requested context distance.  To defer the parsing of a ",
"pattern to when the text is exposed, click on the Pass-2 pattern type button ",
"in the highlight patterns dialog. ",
"\n\n",
"Sometimes a pattern can't be deferred, not because of context requirements, ",
"but because it must run concurrently with pass-1 (non-deferred) patterns.  If ",
"they didn't run concurrently, a pass-1 pattern might incorrectly match some ",
"of the characters which would normally be hidden inside of a sequence matched ",
"by the deferred pattern.  For example, C has character constants enclosed in ",
"single quotes.  These typically do not cross line boundaries, meaning they ",
"can be parsed entirely within the context distance of the C pattern set and ",
"should be good candidates for deferred parsing.  However, they can't be ",
"deferred because they can contain sequences of characters which can trigger ",
"pass-one patterns. Specifically, the sequence, '\\\"', contains a double quote ",
"character, which would be matched by the string pattern and interpreted as ",
"introducing a string. ",
"\n\n",
"\01SPattern Context Requirements\01I",
"\n\n",
"The context requirements of a pattern set state how much additional text ",
"around any change must be examined to guarantee that the patterns will match ",
"what they are intended to match.  Context requirements are a promise by NEdit ",
"to the pattern writer, that the regular expressions in his/her patterns will ",
"be matched against at least <line context> lines and <character context> ",
"characters, around any modified text.  Combining line and character ",
"requirements guarantee that both will be met. ",
"\n\n",
"Automatic re-parsing happens on EVERY KEYSTROKE, so the amount of context ",
"which must be examined is very critical to typing efficiency.  The more ",
"complicated your patterns, the more critical the context becomes.  To cover ",
"all of the keywords in a typical language, without affecting the maximum rate ",
"at which users can enter text, you may be limited to just a few lines and/or ",
"a few hundred characters of context. ",
"\n\n",
"The default context distance is 1 line, with no minimum character ",
"requirement.  There are several benefits to sticking with this default.  One ",
"is simply that it is easy to understand and to comply with.  Regular ",
"expression notation is designed around single line matching.  To span lines ",
"in a regular expression, you must explicitly mention the newline character ",
"\"\\n\", and matches which are restricted to a single line are virtually immune ",
"to lock-ups.  Also, if you can code your patterns to work within a single ",
"line of context, without an additional character-range context requirement, ",
"the parser can take advantage the fact that patterns don't cross line ",
"boundaries, and nearly double its efficiency over a one-line and 1-character ",
"context requirement.  (In a single line context, you are allowed to match ",
"newlines, but only as the first and/or last character.) ",
NULL

static char * htxt_smart_indent [] = {
"\01ISmart indent macros can be written for any language, but are usually more ",
"difficult to write than highlighting patterns.  A good place to start, of ",
"course, is to look at the existing macros for C and C++. ",
"\n\n",
"Smart indent macros for a language mode consist of standard NEdit macro ",
"language code attached to any or all of the following three activation ",
"conditions: 1) When smart indent is first turned on for a text window ",
"containing code of the language, 2) When a newline is typed and smart indent ",
"is expected, 3) after any character is typed.  To attach macro code to any of ",
"these code \"hooks\", enter it in the appropriate section in the Preferences -> ",
"Default Settings -> Auto Indent -> Program Smart Indent dialog. ",
"\n\n",
"Typically most of the code should go in the initialization section, because ",
"that is the appropriate place for subroutine definitions, and smart indent ",
"macros are complicated enough that you are not likely to want to write them ",
"as one monolithic run of code.  You may also put code in the Common/Shared ",
"Initialization section (accessible through the button in the upper left ",
"corner of the dialog).  Unfortunately, since the C/C++ macros also reside in ",
"the common/shared section, when you add code there, you run some risk of ",
"missing out on future upgrades to these macros, because your changes will ",
"override the built-in defaults. ",
"\n\n",
"The newline macro is invoked after the user types a newline, but before the ",
"newline is entered in the buffer.  It takes a single argument ($1) which is ",
"the position at which the newline will be inserted.  It must return the ",
"number of characters of indentation the line should have, or -1.  A return ",
"value of -1 means to do a standard auto-indent.  You must supply a newline ",
"macro, but the code: \"return -1\" (auto-indent), or \"return 0\" (no indent) is ",
"sufficient. ",
"\n\n",
"The type-in macro takes two arguments.  $1 is the insert position, and $2 is ",
"the character just typed, and does not return a value.  It also is invoked ",
"before the character is inserted into the buffer.  You can do just about ",
"anything here, but keep in mind that this macro is executed for every ",
"keystroke typed, so if you try to get too fancy, you may degrade performance. ",

"Preamble ",
"\n\n",
"The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to ",
"share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended ",
"to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the ",
"software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to ",
"most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program ",
"whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation ",
"software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You ",
"can apply it to your programs, too. ",
"\n\n",
"When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our ",
"General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom ",
"to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you ",
"wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you ",
"can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that ",
"you know you can do these things. ",
"\n\n",
"To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to ",
"deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These ",
"restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute ",
"copies of the software, or if you modify it. ",
"\n\n",
"For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or ",
"for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You ",
"must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you ",
"must show them these terms so they know their rights. ",
"\n\n",
"We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) ",
"offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute ",
"and/or modify the software. ",
"\n\n",
"Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that ",
"everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the ",
"software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to ",
"know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced ",
"by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. ",
"\n\n",
"Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We ",
"wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will ",
"individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program ",
"proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be ",
"licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. ",
"\n\n",
"The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification ",
"follow. ",
"\n\n",
"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND ",
"MODIFICATION ",
"\n\n",
"0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice ",
"placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms ",
"of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such ",
"program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program ",
"or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing ",
"the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or ",
"translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included ",
"without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as ",
"\"you\". ",
"\n\n",
"Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered ",
"by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program ",
"is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its ",
"contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been ",
"made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the ",
"Program does. ",
"\n\n",
"1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code ",
"as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and ",
"appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and ",
"disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this ",
"License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of ",
"the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. ",
"\n\n",
"You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may ",
"at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. ",
"\n\n",
"2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, ",
"thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such ",
"modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you ",
"also meet all of these conditions: ",
"\n\n",
"a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating ",
"that you changed the files and the date of any change. ",
"\n\n",
"b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or ",
"in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be ",
"licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of ",
"this License. ",
"\n\n",
"c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, ",
"you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the ",
"most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an ",
"appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or ",
"else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute ",
"the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy ",
"of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does ",
"not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is ",
"not required to print an announcement.) ",
"\n\n",
"These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable ",
"sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably ",
"considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, ",
"and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as ",
"separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole ",
"which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be ",
"on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to ",
"the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. ",
"\n\n",
"Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your ",
"rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the ",
"right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on ",
"the Program. ",
"\n\n",
"In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with ",
"the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or ",
"distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this ",
"License. ",
"\n\n",
"3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under ",
"Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 ",
"and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: ",
"\n\n",
"a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source ",
"code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above ",
"on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, ",
"\n\n",
"b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to ",
"give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically ",
"performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the ",
"corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 ",
"and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, ",
"\n\n",
"c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to ",
"distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for ",
"noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object ",
"code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b ",
"above.) ",
"\n\n",
"The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making ",
"modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all ",
"the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface ",
"definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and ",
"installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source ",
"code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in ",
"either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, ",
"and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that ",
"component itself accompanies the executable. ",
"\n\n",
"If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to ",
"copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the ",
"source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, ",
"even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the ",
"object code. ",
"\n\n",
"4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as ",
"expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, ",
"sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically ",
"terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received ",
"copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses ",
"terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. ",
"\n\n",
"5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. ",
"However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the ",
"Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you ",
"do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the ",
"Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of ",
"this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, ",
"distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. ",
"\n\n",
"6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), ",
"the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to ",
"copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. ",
"You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of ",
"the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance ",
"by third parties to this License. ",
"\n\n",
"7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent ",
"infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), ",
"conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or ",
"otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse ",
"you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to ",
"satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other ",
"pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the ",
"Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit ",
"royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies ",
"directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both ",
"it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the ",
"Program. ",
"\n\n",
"If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any ",
"particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and ",
"the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. ",
"\n\n",
"It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents ",
"or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; ",
"this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free ",
"software distribution system, which is implemented by public license ",
"practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of ",
"software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent ",
"application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or ",
"she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee ",

"means that as you move the mouse around the screen, the window under the ",
"mouse automatically gets the keyboard focus.  NEdit users who use this ",
"focus model should set \"Popups Under Pointer\" in the Default Settings sub ",
"menu of the preferences menu in NEdit.  Users with the explicit focus ",
"model, in some cases, may have problems with certain dialogs, such as Find ",
"and Replace.  In MWM this is caused by the mwm resource startupKeyFocus ",
"being set to False (generally a bad choice for explicit focus users). ",
"NCDwm users should use the focus model \"click\" instead of \"explicit\", ",
"again, unless you have set it that way to correct specific problems, this ",

"\n\n",
"S: While this is an X/Motif binding problem, and should be solved outside of ",

"\01IThe Tabs dialog controls both the operation of the Tab key, and ",
"the interpretation of tab characters within a file. ",
"\n\n",
"The first field, Tab Spacing, controls how  NEdit responds to ",
"tab characters in a file.  On most Unix and VMS systems the ",
"conventional interpretation of a tab character is to advance the ",
"text position to the nearest multiple of eight characters (a tab ",
"spacing of 8).  However, many programmers of C and other ",
"structured languages, when given the choice, prefer a tab ",
"spacing of 3 or 4 characters.  Setting a three or four character ",
"hardware tab spacing is useful and convenient as long as your ",
"other software tools support it.  Unfortunately, on Unix and VMS ",
"systems, system utilities, such as more, and printing software ",
"can't always properly display files with other than eight ",
"character tabs. ",
"\n\n",
"Selecting \"Emulate Tabs\" will cause the Tab key to insert the ",
"correct number of spaces or tabs to reach the next tab stop, as ",
"if the tab spacing were set at the value in the \"Emulated tab ",
"spacing\" field.  Backspacing immediately after entering an ",
"emulated tab will delete it as a unit, but as soon as you move ",
"the cursor away from the spot, NEdit will forget that the ",
"collection of spaces and tabs is a tab, and will treat it as ",
"separate characters.  To enter a real tab character with ",
"\"Emulate Tabs\" turned on, use Ctrl+Tab. ",
"\n\n",
"In generating emulated tabs, and in Shift Left, Paste Column, ",
"and some rectangular selection operations, NEdit inserts blank ",
"characters (spaces or tabs) to preserve the alignment of ",
"non-blank characters. The bottom toggle button in the Tabs ",
"dialog instructs NEdit whether to insert tab characters as ",
"padding in such situations. Turning this off, will keep NEdit ",
